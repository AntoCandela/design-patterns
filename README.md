# Design Patterns in Practice
This repository contains simple implementations of all design patterns, categorized into:

- **Behavioral Patterns**  
- **Structural Patterns**  
- **Creational Patterns**  
  - **Singleton**  

## Singleton Pattern
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global access point** to it.  
This repository includes a **Logger project** that follows the Singleton pattern:  
- It **creates a single Logger instance** that is shared across the application.  
- Logs messages to a **file (`log.txt`)**, ensuring **persistent logging**.  
- Prevents multiple instances, maintaining a **centralized logging system**.  

Each pattern has its own folder with a small project demonstrating its use.
